How I am learning basic Linux system administration

https://linuxupskillchallenge.org/ | https://github.com/livialima/linuxupskillchallenge

## A monthlong course designed to increase admin skills of a remote [[Linux]] server from the command line

### What is it about?
1. Learn Linux enough to admin your own server
2. Focus on practical skills
3. Hands-on experience
4. Acquire skills during the month, 1-2 hours a day
5. Lots of curated external links
6. Much less 'formal' than other Linux trainings ([[RHEL]], Linux Foundation)

### Why am I doing this?
I wish to learn Linux system administration. This feels like a vital IT skill, as well as a fun project to work on in my free time. Excited to dive in and have a great time with this!
